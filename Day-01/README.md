# Day 01: Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

Welcome to Day 01 of your journey into the world of Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking. This session introduces you to the core fundamentals and operational domains that define modern cybersecurity.

## 📌 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the **practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs** from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money; or interrupting normal business processes.

> "Cybersecurity is not just a technology issue, but a business and human-centric concern."

## 🔐 Three Key Domains in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is broadly classified into **three operational domains**, each with a distinct role in securing digital infrastructure:

### 1. **Blue Team** (Defensive Security)

* Focuses on detection, prevention, and incident response.
* Tools: SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR, Firewall.
* Activities: Monitoring, log analysis, threat hunting, patching.

### 2. **Red Team** (Offensive Security)

* Conducts ethical hacking to simulate real-world attacks.
* Tools: Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux.
* Activities: Penetration testing, social engineering, exploitation.

### 3. **Purple Team** (Collaboration/Integration)

* Bridges the gap between Red and Blue teams.
* Ensures continuous improvement of detection and defense.
* Activities: Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTP) sharing, joint simulations.

## 📘 What a Beginner (L1) Learner Will Learn Today

### ✅ Core Learning Outcomes:

* Understand the **definition and scope** of cybersecurity.
* Recognize the **importance of cyber defense** in today’s digital world.
* Get introduced to the **three core teams** in cybersecurity: Blue, Red, and Purple.
* Understand basic tools and tasks performed by each domain.
* Develop a mindset for **ethical hacking and responsible disclosure**.

### ✅ Beginner Mindset:

* Ask questions like "How can I defend this system?" or "Where might this system be vulnerable?"
* Start building familiarity with terminal commands and basic network concepts.
* Stay curious, analytical, and proactive.
